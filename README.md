# DNA Stranding
This software is designed to detect(segment) DNA fiber from DNA fluorescence image and subsequently perform fiber quantification and categorization. A software graphical user interface (GUI) is developed associated with the algorithm for more flexible DNA fiber analysis. User can perform manual, semi-auto, and fully auto DNA quantification analysis using the software.

DNA fiber fluorescence image has been widely used for DNA replication and repair dynamics study. Traditional DNA fiber quantification is relied on manual examination of DNA fluorescence image via image processing platform. This process is time-consuming and laborious and may suffer from inter-observer variation. An automatic DNA fiber analysis software is hence needed. The dedicated software is able to accurately detect and quantify DNA fiber from DNA fluorescence image.
